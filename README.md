# Emergency-Surveillance
A brief introduction on project : 

 The project titled "Emergency surveilance" resembles to a console application programme which deals with different emergency aspects , for instance - ambulance, fire-service , police and rescue troops ardently required at the time of need. The ultimate goal is satisfy the urge of emergency situations of  general mass at the time of need  by providing appropraite contact info and other stuffs . Specifically , this service (for the time being) is only applicable for three cosmopoliton areas of Dhaka city , namely: mirpur , cantonment & motijheel . 
 
 
 OOP concepts that were implemented: 
 
 1. Class and object
 2. Constructor
 3. Encapsulation
 4. Inheritance
 5. Polymorphism
 6. Abstraction
 7. Vector(a container of stl)
 8. File handling
 9. Operator overloading
 10. Inline function
 (11) I/O operations and so on
 
 Description of the project :
 
  At first  , some message are printed for the users (operated through file handling) in the console regarding the type of emergency service they require. 
  Based on their input , either releavent info associated to the services are shown in the console as long as they choose to keep on selecting service options (inside a do while loop ) or the programme terminates (if user selects option to exit).
  In the above loop , new objects of every single emergency classes were created dynamically using vector and their member pure virtual functions' operations  were also implemented. After that , dynamically allocated memory were de-allocated so that no memory could be wasted.
  Above all , the programme ensures user susceptibility and endeavours to maximize providing assocaited info and tools.
